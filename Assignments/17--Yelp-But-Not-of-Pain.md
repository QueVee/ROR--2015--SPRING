# 17 -- Yelp, But Not of Pain 

## Description

Let's keep the party going, and by "party" I mean "Rails app we started writing this morning". That sentence makes me reevaluate some things.

We got the beginning of a restaurant review site, in that there's a restaurant. But there's no reviews. You guys have been asking for review for weeks, so here's your chance. Add a review resource, so that a review can be posted by a user. (You'll need users too.) We haven't done anything on logging in users, so you can either go completely insane and figure out authentication on your own by tomorrow *OR* you can put a select box in the review form and select the user for the review that way. It's a hack.

There are a couple other places where select boxes would make sense. Not just in the review form, either.

Make the restaurant page show its reviews, and put the form to add a review on that same page. Look into nested resources for the review creation method. Format the reviews to display nicely in a list under the restaurant information. 

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

Object creation through forms and display in templates. You get a handle on that, you'll have a future in this business.

### Deliverables

* A functioning, if probably ugly, restaurant review site, with restaurants, users, and reviews of restaurants posted by (or at least attributed to) users. 
* Update your wiki afterwards
